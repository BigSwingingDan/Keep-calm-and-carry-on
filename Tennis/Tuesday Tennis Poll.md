🎾 Tuesday Evening Tennis 07/10 🎾

Happy weekend everyone - as per normal please us know if you would like to play tennis next Tuesday so we can get an idea of how many courts will be required.

Venue: TBC (Likely Vall Parc or Montjuïc)
Court Cost: (Likely 8ish each)

The Saturday before the event I’ll take a snapshot of the poll results and organize the games. Due to many changes, dropouts and lates we are taking a much strict approach to player management. Any infringements will likely result in removal from the group so please be cautious and communicate issues early.

# Keep Calm and Carry On üèêüéæ‚öΩ

Hello!

You have probably been sent this page as we wanted to take a moment to explain the purpose of our community so it‚Äôs clear what we‚Äôre about. As there has been some hostile sentiments about the creation & growth of our community.

## What We Do
- **Keep Calm and Carry On** is a **not-for-profit community** for English speakers in Barcelona.  
- We connect people through a wide variety of sports and activities ‚Äî from padel to volleyball and more.  
- Our aim is to **host weekly events** across different sports, making it easy for people to stay active and meet others.  

## How We Relate to Other Communities
- We know there are already many great WhatsApp and Meetup groups in Barcelona.  
- Our community will naturally look similar in some ways, but our goal isn‚Äôt to compete.  
- Instead, we want to **collaborate**:  
  - Share events across groups.  
  - Help fill games that sometimes struggle for players.  
  - Make it easier for people to discover different sports and activities.  

## Our Approach
- **Non-commercial**: We avoid commercial elements wherever possible.  
- **Inclusive**: Open to all levels and backgrounds.  
- **Collaborative**: We believe that by bringing people together, **everyone benefits** ‚Äî both players and other communities.  

## FAQ

- Can you merge and come under our umbreller
    - We would not like to do this at this time 

- Why could you not do this within our group.
    - This depends on the group but mostly down to decission making and control.

If you‚Äôre an admin of another group and would like to chat about how we could work together, we‚Äôd love to connect.  

At the end of the day, we all share the same goal: helping people in Barcelona stay active, meet new friends and enjoy thier time here.

# Notes

Other communities sometimes have strong views about ‚Äúdilution.‚Äù Often, any interaction with their members can be interpreted as advertising.  

To handle this well, we should;
- **Clarify our intent and motivation**: we are building a **non-commercial sports community** to help people get social and active, while working alongside other communities with regular events.  
- **Acknowledge their work**: overlap is natural, and we should agree on boundaries for what we can and can‚Äôt do within their communities.  
- **Invite collaboration and be transparent**: look for ways we can help them (e.g., posting their events, sharing opportunities).  
- **Remind them that overlap will happen**: ultimately, members will choose where they feel most comfortable and engaged.  

Achieving this may not be simple/possible with some communities, especially where the organisers;
- Are heavily emotionally invested in their group and what they have built.  
- Operate with a **scarcity mindset**, worrying about ‚Äúlosing‚Äù active members in Barcelona.  
- Run their groups with a **commercial element**, making them more like competitive businesses.  
- Are not open to negotiation and prefer to stick to their tried-and-tested approach.

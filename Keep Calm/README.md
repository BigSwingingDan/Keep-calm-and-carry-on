# Welcome to Keep Calm and Carry On 🏐🎾⚽

Hi there, and welcome!

We’re excited to have you join **Keep Calm and Carry On**, a community for English speakers in Barcelona who want to stay active, meet new people, and have fun through sports.  

## What We’re About
- We are a **not-for-profit community** built around sports and social connection.  
- Our goal is to bring people together through activities such as padel, volleyball, pingpong, hiking, and more!
- We host **weekly events** across different sports, open to all levels.  

## Our Values
- **Inclusive**: Everyone is welcome, no matter your background or skill level.  
- **Collaborative**: We often work with other groups and communities in Barcelona.  
- **Non-commercial**: This is about people, not profit.  

## How It Works
- Events are posted in our WhatsApp community channels.  
- You can join any event you’re interested in — just RSVP and show up!  
- If you’re new to a sport, don’t worry — many of us are here to learn and improve together.  

## A Few Guidelines
- Be respectful and supportive of others.  
- Show up if you commit to an event (or let us know ASAP if plans change).  
- Keep things friendly — this is about having fun and meeting people.  

## Why We Exist
Barcelona has many great groups and communities, but we wanted a space that brings different sports and activities **together under one roof**. By doing so, we make it easier to find players/sports/activites and create an interface between all the vibrant communities in barcelona where everyone benefits.

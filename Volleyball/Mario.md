It’s really great to have you here. As Chris mentioned, we actually have a variety of games going on. Usually, it all depends on how enthusiastic and proactive people are. During the day, someone might just ask if others are up for playing that same day, and often a group will head to a beach around Barcelona (Bogatell, Nova Icària, Somorrostro, or Barceloneta) where there are public nets available. Usually, a few people bring a ball, and everyone just joins in.

On Saturdays, I also try to organize a beach volleyball session in the evening. I usually create events on this WhatsApp chat around Thursday to see who’s interested, and I’ll bring along the net and some balls. We usually play for about a few hours, and it’s always a lot of fun.

So, if you ever feel like playing on the spur of the moment, just ask in the group, sometimes you’ll find others ready to go the same day. And keep an eye out on Thursdays for the weekend event announcements! 

Btw, we’re also looking forward to organizing some indoor volleyball sessions as winter comes and it starts getting windier at the beach.

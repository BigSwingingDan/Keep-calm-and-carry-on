Hey everyone! 🏐

This Saturday we’ll play beach volleyball from 15:00–19:00 (4 slots of 1 hour each).

📌 How it works:
	•	Each slot will be created as a WhatsApp Event.
	•	Limit: 12 people per slot → so we can play either:
• 3 teams of 4 vs 4, or
• 2 teams of 5 vs 5, with rotations when serving.
	•	First come, first served → if you sign up and the slot already has 12+ people, please avoid joining to reduce confusion.
	•	For now: max 2 slots per person. If after 24h there are still free spots, people already in 2 slots can grab more.
	•	If you don’t find a slot because they’re full, try using this chat to negotiate with someone who’s signed up for multiple slots (I’d avoid DMs so no one feels pressured, but that’s up to you).
	•	If you signed up for a slot and in the end can’t come, please drop out of the event and post it here so another person can take your place — even if it’s last minute.

📍 Location:
Some colleagues suggested trying Nova Icaria beach this time — it’s just 7 minutes from Somorrostro and usually has more public courts.
	•	This way, if some slots end up with more than 12 people, we can spread out and use those public nets (if free).
	•	If others bring extra nets, even better.
	•	If no free space at Nova Icaria, we’ll check Somorrostro, Barceloneta, or Bogatell.
	•	We’ll share our exact location here once we set up.

See you Saturday! ✌

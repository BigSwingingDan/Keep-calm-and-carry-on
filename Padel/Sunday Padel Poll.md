🎾 Sunday Evening Padel 🎾

Please vote for the time slots you will play for next weekend. Keep in mind that if you book multiple slots, you will be volunteering for multiple games. Make sure you check your schedule beforehand, as it takes time to get to and from the venue, and games last 1 hour and 30 minutes.

We normally play between 19:00 and 21:00, followed by drinks and food on the terrace. If you need any information, please PM me.

Venue: https://maps.app.goo.gl/Wn1stTc9ZDHEejAo7
Court Cost: Around 8 Euros/pp
Racket Rental: 4 Euros (the rackets are not good)

On Wednesday evening, I’ll take a snapshot of the poll results and organize the games. Due to many changes and dropouts, we are taking a strict approach to player management. Dropouts will likely result in removal from the group.

Please keep in mind that it’s hard to manage everyone’s abilities and expectation but we will try our best when organising the matches, some times there is good and other times there is bad, try to remain positive!

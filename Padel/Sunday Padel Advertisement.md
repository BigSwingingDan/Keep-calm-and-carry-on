Hey everyone! ğŸ˜Š

Weâ€™re a friendly group of English-speaking padel players, beginners and intermediates, spread all across Barcelona. We organize games several times a week at different spots around the city, so thereâ€™s usually something that fits everyoneâ€™s schedule and level.

Plus, we have a bigger session every weekend (Saturday or Sunday evenings) where we play and then often hang out afterward for drinks and food on a terrace â€” itâ€™s a super chill way to relax and meet new friends!

If youâ€™re interested, have any questions, or want to join in the fun, just hop into our WhatsApp community here:

Canâ€™t wait to see youÂ onÂ theÂ court!

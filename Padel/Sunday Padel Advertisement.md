Hi all,

As mentioned previously, we’ve had some issues with our larger bookings due to not having enough courts compared with other “competitors,” so to speak. The best way I can see to resolve this is by growing our community and booking more courts together!

If you could share our group/community with your friends, groups, or networks, it would be greatly appreciated — I think many others would benefit from joining.

We’re also working on setting up another beginner session soon (possibly on a weekday evening) to help our new players (and some existing ones) get up to speed so they can actively join the bigger sessions.

You can use the template below, which includes a link to our group. Your help is very much appreciated!

Hey everyone! 😊

We’re a friendly group of English-speaking padel players, beginners and intermediates, spread across Barcelona. We organize games several times a week at different spots around the city, so there’s usually something that fits everyone’s schedule and level.

Plus, we have a bigger session every weekend (Saturday or Sunday evenings) where we play and often hang out afterward for drinks and food on a terrace — it’s a super chill way to relax and meet new friends!

If you’re interested, have any questions, or want to join in the fun, just hop into our WhatsApp community here:

Can’t wait to see you on the court!

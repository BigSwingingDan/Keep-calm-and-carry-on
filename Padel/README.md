# Welcome to Keep Calm Padel - Your Sunday Padel Community

We're excited to have you join our growing padel community! Here's how our weekly system works to ensure everyone gets their game on:

## Our Weekly Poll System
Every Saturday morning, we launch our weekly availability poll that stays open through Monday evening. This gives everyone plenty of time to let us know when they're free to play on Sunday, whether that's morning, afternoon, or evening slots.

## Fair Play Guarantee
Our mission is simple but important - we work hard to ensure that every single person who takes the time to vote in our poll gets a guaranteed spot to play padel on Sunday. No one gets left out if they've participated in the voting process.

## How We Make It Work
Based on the poll responses, we organize multiple sessions throughout Sunday to accommodate different schedules and skill levels. Whether you're an early bird who loves a morning match or prefer an afternoon game, we'll find a way to fit you in.

## Community First
This system isn't just about booking courts - it's about building a reliable, inclusive padel community where everyone knows they can count on getting their weekly game. By committing to include all poll participants, we ensure our group stays engaged and grows together.

## Getting Started
Simply watch for our Saturday poll each week and make sure to respond with your Sunday availability. Once you vote, consider your spot secured - we'll take care of the rest!

WELCOME NEW PADELERS 🎾

We're excited to have you join our growing padel community!

As you may have heard from others, we have a weekly poll system which we use to ensure everyone gets their game next Sunday! (The Sunday a week after we run the poll.)

How It Works:

Every Saturday morning, we launch our weekly availability poll that stays open through to roughly Monday evening. This gives everyone plenty of time to let us know when they're free to play on Sunday.

Fair Play Guarantee: Our mission is simple but important - we work hard to ensure that every single person who takes the time to vote in our poll gets a guaranteed spot to play padel on Sunday. We organize multiple sessions on Sunday to accommodate different schedules and skill levels - we'll find a way to fit you in.

Community First: This system isn't just about booking courts - it's about building a reliable, inclusive padel community where everyone knows they can count on getting their weekly game. By committing to include all poll participants, we ensure our group stays engaged and grows together.

Getting Started: Simply watch for our Saturday poll each week and make sure to respond with your Sunday availability. Once you vote, consider your spot secured. On Monday, we will post the games, and you will either have to book a court so players can join you or book onto a court which has already been assigned.

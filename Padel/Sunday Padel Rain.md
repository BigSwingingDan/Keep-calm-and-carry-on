# 🌧️ Rainy Day Padel Process

Playing padel in the rain can be tricky — but it’s also an opportunity to keep the group spirit alive.  

This process explains how we handle matches when the weather isn’t on our side.

## ✅ General Principles
- Matches are **still on** unless:
  - The **venue cancels** the booking on Playtomic, or  
  - **All 4 players** on a specific court agree to cancel and inform **Dan**.  
- We work closely with venues to build a good relationship.  
  - Cancelling all matches just because there *might* be rain is unfair to the venue.  
  - This could harm our ability to block-book in the future.

## 💬 Communication Rules
- **Keep WhatsApp chat minimal.**  
  - Important updates need to be clear and easy to find.  
  - Use **private messages** if possible instead of over utilising the group chat.
- **No negativity.**  
  - Don’t keep talking about the rain or try to persuade others to cancel.  
  - Refrain from ringing the venue, or cancelling through the app.  
- **Dropouts** (even for rain) are treated as **normal dropouts**.  
  - They will receive a strike and be added to the **Wall of Shame**.  
- Do **not** repeatedly ask, “Are we playing?” — if it rains, assume the match is on unless cancelled officially via playtomic.

## 🍻 Social Spirit
Remember: this is a **social group, not just padel**.  
- If the courts close or a game is cancelled, why not grab a drink or some food at the bar?  
- Keep the good vibes going, rain or shine.

## 🏟️ Venue Policy
- If the venue decides the weather/courts are unsafe, games will be cancelled.  
- You will receive a **full refund** in this case.

## 🌦️ Playing in Light Rain
If matches continue in drizzle or after rain:  
- **Take care of your racket.** Water isn’t good for it.  
- **Watch your footing.** Courts may be slippery.  
- **Use spare/rubbish balls.** Dan usually has a bag full for wet conditions.

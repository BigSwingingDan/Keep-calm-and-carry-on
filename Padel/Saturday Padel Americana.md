*Americana on Saturday 12th cancelled. This is a separate event from our normal Sunday matches*

Hi all!

We are going to be organizing our first Americana on *Saturday 18th of October in Aurial! We have 7 courts reserved!

For those that donâ€™t know, an Americana is a friendly tournament where we play 15 min matches and the people that win go to a higher court, people that lose go to a lower court, and everyone changes partners. This means you can do a lot of small matches and play with a lot of people, and levels self-regulate after a few rounds ðŸ˜€  See diagram for an example!

Only cost will be your percentage of the court as always, *you have to pay at reception on the dayðŸ˜€  

If you are interested, please sign up with your level (for initial court placement) in the poll! 

Poll will close on Monday and we will send the phone numbers and names to the venue for them toÂ handleÂ payment
